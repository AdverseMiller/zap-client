# Changelog:

    19.01.24
    Aimbot:
       - Added Delay (Not sure what its called, but it affects smoothing speed? So good for legit players ig
    Sense:
       - Added Status Text (Current Health & Armor)
           - Added Max Status Text (Max Health & Armor)
       - Moved Name and distance positions, distance may get in the way of box/skeleton, will fix eventually

    Crashing still occurs after going back to the lobby, not sure while and will do some testing about it tommorow.
    Not a big deal since you can just run the cheat again after crashing

# Help
**Features not working after changing them? (e.g. aim bind)**
Save config/Load config

**Aimbot not working?**

Check the speed/smoothness, keybind and if you have team gamemode on/off in the wrong mode

**ESP not working?**

Check team gamemode

**Experience Crashes?**

Try toggling features off (namely glow and triggerbot)

So yeah, this thing was made by me, I was very bored so I took T_Tape's Menu and grinder's features and put them together to create this monstrosity. The code is still very messy so if you want to improve it, go ahead.
I'll will be very grateful if you do so.
